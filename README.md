What is it
==================
It is a skeleton project based on [firefly][1] game server framework. You can use it as:
* a start point of real game project
* a learning material of firefly
* a testbed of firefly-based game

It includes a cocos2d-x client to test the skeleton server. The client just connect the server and send a test command, and the server will return hello world.
